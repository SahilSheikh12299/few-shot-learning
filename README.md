# few-shot-learning
Computer vision project for few shot learning using Siamese Networks using Pytorch.

The images should be placed inside the data/faces/training/{person_name} for training and data/faces/testing/{person_name} for testing purposes.

If you are running without a pretrained model, run
'''sh
python main.py
